python interpreter

interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _
- open shell and enter these commands one after another
- python3
- 2+4
- print(_)          // prints 6

========================================

word23 = 'learning Python'
word23[3]
word23[0:2]           // slicing
word23[:2]              // slicing


Python strings cannot be changed â€” they are immutable
word23[0] = 'J'               // throws ERROR


len(word23)                 // length
========================================
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type

squares[2] = 9.00           // allowed
squares.append(36)
==================================================
