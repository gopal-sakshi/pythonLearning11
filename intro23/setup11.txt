For Unix-based systems, 
- we try to use system libraries whenever available. 
- This means optional components will only build if the relevant system headers are available

(A) install all necessary packages/libraries in ubuntu

    sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb lcov pkg-config \
        libbz2-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev \
        libncurses5-dev libreadline6-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev \
        lzma lzma-dev tk-dev uuid-dev zlib1g-dev


(B) then, install python from source
    ./configure
    make test
    sudo make install
