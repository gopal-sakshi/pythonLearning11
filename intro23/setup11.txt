For Unix-based systems, 
- we try to use system libraries whenever available. 
- This means optional components will only build if the relevant system headers are available

(A) install all necessary packages/libraries in ubuntu
    
    --- not sure which of these two I need ...
    
    sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb lcov pkg-config \
        libbz2-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev libgdbm-compat-dev liblzma-dev \
        libncurses5-dev libreadline6-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev \
        lzma lzma-dev tk-dev uuid-dev zlib1g-dev

    sudo apt-get install \
        curl \
        gcc \
        libbz2-dev \
        libev-dev \
        libffi-dev \
        libgdbm-dev \
        liblzma-dev \
        libncurses-dev \
        libreadline-dev \
        libsqlite3-dev \
        libssl-dev \
        make \
        tk-dev \
        wget \
        zlib1g-dev
