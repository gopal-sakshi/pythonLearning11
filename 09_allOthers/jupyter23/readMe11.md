`Notebooks`
- integrates code & its output into a single document
- combines visualizations, text, maths equations, rich media

Jupyterâ€™s Notebooks and dashboard are `web apps`
Jupyter starts up a local Python server to serve these apps to your web browser
So, it is platform independent

`ipynb file`
- each ipynb file === 1 notebook
- stores the content of notebook in JSON format


`Kernel`
- computational engine that executes the code

`Cell`
- display the code to be executed by kernel
